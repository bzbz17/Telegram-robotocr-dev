# This file is a "Blueprint" for Render.com.
# It tells Render how to build and deploy your services.
#
# You can deploy this by creating a new "Blueprint Instance" on Render
# and connecting it to your GitHub repository.
#
# For more details, see: https://render.com/docs/blueprint-spec

services:
  # 1. Frontend: A static site for the React UI
  # This part will be automatically deployed by Render.
  - type: staticSite
    name: telegram-ocr-frontend
    env: react
    # The build command to run to generate the static files
    buildCommand: yarn build
    # The directory where the built static files are located
    publishDir: dist
    # The VITE_API_URL should be set in the Render dashboard environment
    # variables to connect this frontend to your backend service.

  # 2. Backend: A web service for your bot logic (Placeholder)
  # You will need to create your backend code (e.g., in Node.js or Python)
  # and then create a "Web Service" on Render for it.
  # To keep it "always on", you may need a paid plan on Render.
  #
  # Example for a Node.js backend:
  # - type: web
  #   name: telegram-ocr-backend
  #   env: node
  #   startCommand: "node index.js"
  #   envVars:
  #     - key: TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN # Set this as a secret in the Render dashboard
  #       sync: false
